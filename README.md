uhx1_uart_pcb
=============

A UART Interface PCB Board design for Radiometrix UHX1

The schematics are drawn with Proteus ISIS and the PCB is drawn with Proteus ARES.
In the repo, you can find the Gerber and Excellon outputs. 
These outputs are in the uhx1 - CADCAM.zip

The PCB with new parts compatible with Farnell with GplEDA (geda) tools is also added in the geda_pcb directory.
